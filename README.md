Given data sets with information about energy usage for houses in Western Massachusetts, house characteristics, and area demographics, our project aims to provide insight and recommendations on which houses can viably transition from gas to solar-powered heating. To identify houses fit for this transition, we devised a solar viability rating; this value condenses the usable sunlight a house receives throughout the year, the house’s current energy demands and available roof space, and the household’s annual income to quantify a house’s solar potential. In short, these households will be able to afford sufficient solar panels to generate enough energy to match the current energy consumption spent on gas heating. We strove to answer the following research questions as we completed our project and analysis:
How can we quantify a given household’s solar potential given hours of sunlight per day and square footage available for solar panels?
Which households that currently use gas heating have solar potentials that indicate solar energy can power their current consumption? 
Can we identify blocks with high amounts of houses viable for a transition to solar, and market/enforce policy to increase solar energy uptake?
